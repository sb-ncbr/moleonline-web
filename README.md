# MOLEonline

MOLEonline web interface provides direct access to MOLE functionality and enables on-line and easy-to-use interactive channel analysis.

MOLE 2.5 is a universal toolkit for rapid and fully automated location and characterization of channels, tunnels and pores in (bio)macromolecular structures, e.g., proteins, RNA, DNA and biomacromolecular assemblies.

Our latest version of MOLEonline brings many notable improvements, including:

- Replacement of deprecated LiteMol with the modern Mol* viewer,
- colour the tunnels in the 3D view according to their physicochemical properties,
- a new 2D view of the structure and calculated tunnels is generated by 2DProts,
- ability to store tunnels into the mmCIF file,
- ability to store and load computation settings.
